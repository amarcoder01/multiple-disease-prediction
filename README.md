Overview

In today’s healthcare landscape, timely diagnosis is critical. Manual assessments based on patient data can be time-consuming and inconsistent. This project addresses those challenges by:
Predicting multiple diseases**: Automates disease prediction using various ML models.
Improving accuracy**: Leverages ensemble methods to enhance prediction accuracy.
Enabling early intervention**: Supports healthcare professionals in making informed decisions quickly.

Features
Multi-Disease Prediction: Capable of predicting diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's.
Multiple ML Models: Implements Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks to compare performance.
User-Friendly Interface: Utilizes Streamlit to offer an intuitive, web-based interface for data input and result visualization.
Data Visualization: Provides graphical representations of model predictions and performance metrics.
Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets and adapt to additional diseases or models.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization & Interface: Streamlit
## Installation

Prerequisites

Python:Version 3.9 or higher (check with `python --version`).
Git:Ensure Git is installed on your system.
Virtual Environment (Recommended):** Use tools like `venv` or `conda` to manage dependencies.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   
   git clone https://github.com/amarcoder01/multiple-disease-prediction.git
   cd multiple-disease-prediction
   

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

3. Install Dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt


 Usage

1. **Run the Application:**
   Start the Streamlit interface (or your designated app file):
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   (Replace `app.py` with your main file name if different.)

2. nteract with the Interface:
    Upload or input patient data.
     View predictions for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson’s.
    Analyze visualizations and performance metrics.
